Installation 
------------

1. Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules

2. You will need an account at twilio.com. If you don't have one you can create
a trial account with a "trial balance" to allow you to experiment. When the
trial is over, you'll need at least one Twilio number, $1.00 per month as of now
(August 2017).  Usage rates are on the site. Example: domestic USA SMS text
messages are $.0075 each as of now.

3. Visit 'admin/config/system/twilio' and enter your Twilio API information
found on the twilio dashboard.
